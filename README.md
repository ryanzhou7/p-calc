### Description
This application creates a diagnostic metric (loss percentage) that is 10X more accurate than trained eye surgeons' estimates(for the treatment of Ptosis). For example, [this paper!](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481509) shows the average mean percent error of oculoplastic surgeons' visual estimates was 19.75% whereas this app produces estimates with <2% error. This is achieved via combining several image processing techniques along with a breadth first search algorithm.

### Demo
